\subsection{Block Design}

We are interested in the simple block experiment in this research, so we first 
fitted a block design experiment to ordinary least square (OLS) regression in 
order to define the basic relationship between BOLD signals and task 
stimulus. Here, we assumed that the errors follow independent and identically 
normal distribution and have a constant variance.

\end{figure}

Since $\hat{\beta_{3}}$ in 2 dimensions is not easy to recognize which voxels
are significantly active, we would like to reshape it to 3 dimensions. 
Then, we plotted the $\hat{\beta_{3}}$ and P-value of front, middle and 
back perspectives respectively. Figure 4 is for the middle perspective. The plots
of front and back perspectives are in Appendix.

\end{figure}

In the $\hat{\beta}$ map, the warmer color is showing $\hat{\beta}$ is 
bigger, which means there is higher positive relationship between BOLD signals 
and task stimulus. However, if the color is more yellow, it means 
$\hat{\beta}$ is close to 0 and there is little relationship. Therefore, we conclude 
that the voxels are highly active during the experiment test located at the center 
of front and back brain. On the other hand, in the middle brain, majority of voxel 
are showing the negative relationship between BOLD signals and task stimulus.

In the p-value map, the dark region is showing higher confidence on the 
$\hat{\beta}$ values. From the color of the region, we can judge whether or 
not these voxels are related to our experiment test. We could not 
find many regions are highly significantly. If the voxels are on the 
edge of the brain, most of them did not provide any information in the blood flow, 
which makes sense.

\end{figure}

In the left image, we set the threshold to 0.05, so find the red region contains
highly signoitificant active voxels. In the right image, as Bonferroni correction 
suggests, we decide to set the threshold to 0.05/133, then we get a few very 
significant regions. However, most of them are located at the edge of brain, 
which does not make sense in the common knowledge. Therefore, we did not 
firmly believe this results, so in the next section, we are going to check 
heteroscedasticity test.

\subsection{Heteroscedasticity Test}

In the paper, it introduces that there is non-constant variance of blood 
measurement in the dataset, which means it breaks the assumption of ordinary 
least squares. If the variance of the Y is not constant, then the error variance
will not be constant because it assumes there is linear relationship between 
true Y and X. The most common form of such heteroscedasticity in Y is that the 
variance of Y may increase as the mean of Y increases, for data with positive X
and Y. We would like to apply heteroscedasticity test, called White test in order to 
statistically test on variance.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set the null hypothesis: no heteroscedasticity; Ha: there is heteroscedasticity
\item Estimate by OLS, save squared residuals in $e^2$
\item Regress $e^2$ on all variables, their squares and all possible non-redundant cross-products
\item Form the auxiliar regression: $n R^2 ~ X^2(p)$
\item Reject if $n R^2$ is too large
\end{enumerate}
Intuition: The auxiliary model can be seen as trying to model the variance of 
the error term. If the $R^2$ of this auxiliary regression were high, then we could
explain the behavior of the squared residuals, providing evidence that they are
not constant.

\caption{P value for Heteroscedasticity Test in Block Design}
\end{figure}

In the figure, we can see only few points under the red line, which voxels are
been rejected the null hypothesis test. 

The result we got is that there are total 194287 voxels, but only 3868 voxels 
have the significant P value which means reject our null hypothesis. Because 
only 2\% voxels have the constant variance, we judge the most voxels keep 
non-constant variance in the dataset. Therefore, we could not apply OLS regression, 
however, a weighted least squares linear regression 
may be the preferred method of dealing with non-constant variance of error.
