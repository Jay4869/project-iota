\section{Diagnostic}
\subsection{ANOVA Test}
First of all, ideally, since the block design is highly correlated to trial 
design, we might get the collinearity issue in our model, we would like to check
that keeping only either one design will be good enough for our generalized 
linear regression. To address this question, we apply ANOVA test to figure which
design will be the best variable in the model. In the null hypothesis, we would
like to test $\hat{\beta_{block}}$ = 0 or $\hat{\beta_{trial}}$ = 0, and prefer
the model has the lowest residual sum of square.
The RSS we get from ANOVO test is that 253183.7, 263744.3, 260204.09 for mixed
design, model without block design, and model without trial design. Because of 
the lowest RSS of mixed design, we decide to choose mixed model to do further 
analysis.

\subsection{Cross Validation}
Next, since we have already tested the mixed design model works pretty well, we are 
going to apply 5-folds cross validation to select model with or withough 
discrete cosin transformation (DCT), and we are going to decide which model is 
based on cross validation score which is mean of squared errors.
Mean of squared errors (mixed design no dct):  71461.0961108
Mean of squared errors (mixed design with dct):  191332664.585
Therefore, the final model we select is mixed design without DCT because the MSE
is lower.

\subsection{Comparing 2-back and 0-back}
Finally, in the experiment design, we know the 2-back test is containing the 
longest memory in the brain, however, 0-back test is only containing the shortest
memory, so we are also interested in how these voxels store human memory.
Ideally, we fit our final design models to both 0-back and 2-back test, and 
get back two $\hat{\beta}$ from two models. Then, we set the null hypothesis test
for t-test which is $\hat{\beta_{0back}}$ - $\hat{\beta_{2back}}$ = 0. We will
reject the null hypothesis test if p value is smaller than 0.05/133 because of 
Bonferroni correction. The result we get is that there are only 108 rejected 
the null hypothesis which means these voxels have high confidence to store the 
2 second long memory.
