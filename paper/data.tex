\section{Data}

The fMRI data used in the published paper is available on the website OpenFMRI.org.
The are many data files grouped by subjects, but we will be focusing on only one
schizophrenic subject--subject 001, who is male, Caucasian and Schizophrenic.
The raw data has four dimensions (91 $\times$ 109 $\times$ 91 $\times$ 137), 
consisting of three dimensional voxels that are moving across time. We removed 
the first four outlying data along the time dimension, which leaves us with 
133 images.
