\subseciton{Mean voxels mask}
We plot sample images of the brain from three different perspectives, which 
show how our dataset looks like. Since the paper talks about the noise 
in the data, we average our data by time and plot a histogram to check noise 
variance. The dataset contains a lot of signal noise at the outskirt of the 
brain. Based on the histogram, we decide to set the threshold to 8000 which 
includes the majority of unuseful information, so we extract the data that are 
larger than 8000 such that all signal noise is removed.
