Project Group Iota

##### Project General Information

Data:
(1) We have 4 groups of participants: schizophrenia patients, patients' siblings,
normal people, and normal people's siblings.
(2) We have 4 tasks: R, 1B, 2B, 3B.
(3) We have 4 ROIs: FP, CO, CER, DMN.

Original Paper Objectives:
1. Within-network connectivity:
(a) For each participant, find connectivity within each ROI on different tasks.
2. Between-network connectivity:connectivity
(a) For each participant, find connectivity between each ROI on different tasks.

Our Project Objectives:
1.Simplified assumptions:
(a) Since we do not have the knowledge about partition the brain into ROIs, we
will simply focus on the entire brain.
(b) Since we do not have the knowledge of comparing different subjects who have
different brain shapes, we will simply visually compare brain images and
approximate.
2. For each subject Identify signal strength in response to stimulus.  

##### Tentative Roadmap

General to do list:
1. Get convolved time course and save as convolved.txt.
2. Make design matrix using convolved.txt and run regression on BOLD signals to
get the estimated betas. 
(Note: the betas are the scaling of the BOLD signals in response to the
stimulus.)
3. Identify strong signals when performing a specific task.
4. (To be determined)
5.
6.
...

To_Do_chunk_1 (Weeks 11/2 - 11/13): 
1. Make convolved.txt using notes from lecture Day 13 
(reference: http://www.jarrodmillman.com/rcsds/lectures/convolution_background.html). 

2. Make design matrix using convolved.txt and run regression on 2D BOLD signals.
Question: what are we regressing on?
-- We are regressing the BOLD signals with the convolved time course. If the betas
are large, then the BOLD signal is strong in response to the stimulus.
(reference: see introduction of this about convolution: 
http://practical-neuroimaging.github.io/on_convolution.html)

3. Make progress slides for 11/12 progress presentation. 

4. Go to office hours on Friday 11/6 for project questions. 

5. Project-related questions will be asked on Github by creating issues with
specific labels.  

Task Assignment:
-Zeyu is responsible for making weekly plans, and assign tasks. Will be helping
with other teammates with code writing or reviewing as well as slides making.  
-Jie and Qingyuan are responsible for writing code for convolved time course. If
there are questions, ask Zeyu or Yunchuan.
-Yunchuan is responsible for making the progress presentation report.
